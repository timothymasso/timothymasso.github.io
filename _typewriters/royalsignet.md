The Royal Signet is an American-made portable typewriter introduced in the early 1960s, designed as a lightweight and affordable machine for students and casual typists. The 1963 release reflects Royal’s effort to compete in the growing market for streamlined, budget-friendly portables while maintaining the company’s tradition of reliability.  

## History  

Royal, one of the leading American typewriter manufacturers of the 20th century, was best known for its rugged office standards and mid-range portables. By the early 1960s, demand was shifting toward smaller and more affordable machines for home and school use. The Royal Signet was introduced around 1962–63 as a stripped-down, entry-level portable. Unlike Royal’s more feature-rich Quiet Deluxe or Safari models, the Signet emphasized simplicity, portability, and low cost, making it accessible to students and first-time typewriter owners. Its appearance in the 1963 catalog positioned it firmly in the youth and educational markets, where demand for inexpensive yet dependable typewriters was steadily increasing.  

## Features  

The Royal Signet is a compact, plastic-bodied machine that contrasts with the heavier metal-bodied portables of the previous decade. It employed a basket-shift mechanism, ensuring a lighter typing touch than carriage-shift models, though it lacked advanced features like a tabulator or ribbon color selector. The keyboard layout was basic, offering only the essential characters, which further underscored its role as a student’s typewriter. The casing was typically finished in bright, modernist colors of the 1960s, giving it an appealing, contemporary look. Lightweight construction and a simple snap-on lid made the Signet easy to transport, while its no-frills engineering kept it affordable.  

## 1963 Release Context  

The 1963 Royal Signet represents a moment when typewriter manufacturers were seeking to balance design, cost, and usability for a new generation of users. Released alongside more sophisticated Royal models, the Signet catered to a market that valued accessibility over luxury. While not as collectible today as Royal’s more advanced portables, the 1963 Signet remains historically important as an example of the democratization of typing technology during the early 1960s. It reflects both the aesthetic sensibilities and the economic realities of its era — practical, colorful, and built to meet the needs of everyday writers.
