The Olympia SM7 is a German-made portable typewriter from the early 1960s, renowned for its engineering and elegant design. The 1963 release is significant as it marks the final production year of the SM7 model, reflecting both historical importance and peak refinement.

## History

Olympia's SM series began in 1949, establishing a reputation for precision similar to “Mercedes Benz of typewriters”. The SM7 debuted in the early 1960s, representing the culmination of Olympia’s carriage-shifted portables before new mechanisms appeared in later SM models. The year 1963 is the last for the SM7, making surviving units from this year highly collectible and historically notable.

## Features

The Olympia SM7 features an all-metal build, offering durable construction and a crisp, responsive keystroke that ensures reliable typing. It employs a carriage-shift mechanism, known for its smooth action which is a hallmark of Olympia's classic engineering. The typewriter includes practical tabulator functionality along with an audible line-ending bell, enhancing typing rhythm and efficiency. The Olympia SM7 stands out with its unique design, characterized by a square body, textured panels, and period-appropriate color variants. Finally, some units were shipped with custom keysets tailored for professional or scientific use, making the SM7 versatile for specialized typing needs across various industries and disciplines.

## 1963 Release Context

The 1963 SM7 embodies the final refinement of Olympia's carriage-shift portables before the switch to basket-shift in later models, blending classic function with mid-century styling. It stands out for its reliability and is highly sought after by hobbyists and collectors. The 1963 models represent a bridge between vintage craftsmanship and the innovations that followed in Olympia's lineup.
