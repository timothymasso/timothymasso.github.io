The incorrect wiring caused the antiskid system not to function as intended, resulting in the failure of the left outboard tire and a significant loss of the airplane’s braking ability, which led to the runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were (1) Saab’s design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration’s lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers’ inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturer’s limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir’s failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir’s route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane.","Personnel issues - Task performance - Maintenance - Scheduled/routine maintenance - Other, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Main landing gear - Incorrect service/maintenance, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - (general) - Attain/maintain not possible, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Decision making/judgment - Pilot, Environmental issues - Conditions/weather/phenomena - Wind - Tailwind - Decision related to condition, Organizational issues - Development - Design - Equipment design - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Land gear sys wiring - Design, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - (general) - Operator, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - FAA/Regulator, Environmental issues - Operating environment - Airport facilities/design - (general) - Decision related to condition",,"53.898333999999998","-166.54417000000001","Saab","2000","AIR","PADU","Unalaska","false","2","TP","SCHD",,"121","Substantial","VMC","Peninsula AviationServices Inc.,","Landing","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100437","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA20MA002.aspx"

Contributing to the event were: 
-	The presence of water containing dissolved aluminum sulfate (alum) in the airplane fuel system that initiated a sudden blockage of the engine VSV TM SP filter. 
-	The maintenance provider omitted to sump the fuel tanks during the 10-day period of inactivity of the airplane.

The engine fuel control unit attempted to compensate for the decrease in engine performance by increasing the fuel flow rate. The combustion liner damage and increased fuel flow led to incomplete combustion of the fuel injected into the combustion chamber. Unconsumed fuel then ignited downstream of the combustion chamber (delayed ignition) and resulted in high pressure turbine thermal damage, and the eventual separation of a high pressure turbine 2nd stage nozzle vane segment. The separated vane segment subsequently caused low pressure turbine case burn through and catastrophic impact damage to the high and low pressure turbine stages.","Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Combustion section - Fatigue/wear/corrosion",,"41.990276000000001","-87.904724000000002","BOMBARDIER INC","CL 600 2C10","AIR","ORD","Chicago O'Hare Intl","false","2","TF","SCHD",,"121","Minor","Unknown","SKYWEST AIRLINES INC","Takeoff","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=95345","https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/95345/pdf"

Contributing to the probable cause was the lack of instructions to ensure the lock washer was installed in the J5 power terminal block in the Boeing 757 aircraft maintenance manual (AMM). 

Additionally, contributing to the incident was the deferral of the related maintenance write-up before the incident, which resulted from information in the United Airlines AMM that stated, “When bus bar(s) show signs of blackening or burning, the condition is acceptable for continued service, although the window must be replaced within 50 flight-hours.","Aircraft - Aircraft structures - Windows-windshield system - Flight compartment windows - Incorrect service/maintenance, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - Maintenance provider, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Oxygen system - Crew oxygen system - Design, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - FAA/Regulator",,"38.900084999999997","-77.449477999999999","BOEING","757","AIR","IAD","Washington Dulles","false","2","TF","SCHD",,"121","Minor",,,"Enroute","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=76023","https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/76023/pdf"

Contributing to the accident were 1) the Federal Aviation Administration pilot flight and duty time regulations that permitted the pilots' long, demanding duty day and 2) the TVC operations supervisor's use of ambiguous and unspecific radio phraseology in providing runway braking information.

This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing.

Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties.  Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots.  Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.",,,"41.780338","-87.770270999999994","Boeing","737-700","AIR","MDW","Midway Airport","false","2","TF","SCHD",,"121","Substantial","IMC",,,"Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=62926","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA06MA009.aspx"

Contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing only the airport approach lights. The pilots' unprofessional behavior during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.
