Contributing to the severity of the engine fire was the failure of the “K” flange following the fan blade out, which allowed hot ignition gases to enter the nacelle and imparted damage to several components that fed flammable fluids to the nacelle, which allowed the fire to propagate past the undercowl area and into the thrust reversers, where it could not be extinguished.","Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Compressor section - Failure, Organizational issues - Development - Design - Equipment design - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft handling/service - Maintenance/inspections - Scheduled maint checks - Inadequate inspection, Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Compressor section - Fatigue/wear/corrosion",,39.929178999999998,-104.96438999999999,BOEING,777-222,AIR,,,false,2,TF,SCHD,,121,Minor,VMC,United Airlines,Initial Climb,Completed,,Final,https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=102652,https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/102652/pdf

Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties.  Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots.
