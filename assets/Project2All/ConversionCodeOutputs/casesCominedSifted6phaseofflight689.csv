Engine vibrations and fuel pressure cycles caused the bolts to gradually loosen further until one bolt lost all its tightening torque and fell out. The internal fuel pressure then forced open the fuel manifold cover at the location of the missing bolt, causing a gap between the two mating surfaces which allowed fuel to push past the integral packing, resulting in a fuel leak onto the hot engine cases where it ignited resulting in a fire.","Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine fuel and control - Fuel distribution - Incorrect service/maintenance, Personnel issues - Task performance - Maintenance - Installation - Maintenance personnel",,37.779628000000002,-122.419273,BOEING,737,AIR,SFO,San Franciso,false,2,TF,SCHD,,121,None,,Southwest Airlines,Enroute,Completed,,Final,,https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/78108/pdf
