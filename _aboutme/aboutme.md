## Early Years 
I grew up in Cleveland surrounded by music. My father plays guitar and is a sound engineer, so every car ride was filled with tunes that sparked my love for music from an early age. I began on clarinet in fifth grade, then moved to alto saxophone, but after a summer camp where I played baritone for the first time, I fell in love with the horn and its sound. I knew I wanted to dedicate myself to jazz music. 

## High School (2016–2020)  
High school was a wonderful time full of music and growth. I played in concert bands such as the Cleveland Youth Wind Symphony and The Shaker Heights Wind Ensemble. In jazz ensemble programs like Jazz at The Music Settlement (J@MS) and the Tri-C JazzFest Academy. In Show Choir bands for the school competing at Show Choir invitationals. In pit orchestras for musicals performed at the school. And in summer camps where I taught and played.  
- Bill Hughes 
- Dan Crain  
- Mario Clopton-Zymler  
- Ken LeeGrand 
- Bobby Sanabria 

who all guided me, teaching leadership, improvisation, and collaboration. During summers, I attended jazz and Afro-Cuban jazz camps, taught at band camps, and worked in the schools band office organizing scores, cleaning instruments and getting ready for the coming school year. Music was a year round passion. Mario wouldn't even ask me to play for two years in a row at the beginning of the year while I was in another class he would knock on the door as the other teacher if he could talk to me and say here's the music for this year and place a packet on my desk. Which was a packet of the Show Choir music and the first musical they were having for the year. I didn't even have a chance to say no. 

## College Years (2020–2024)  
I studied jazz and contemporary music at The New School’s College of Performing Arts in New York City. I had the privilege of performing in ensembles led by:  
- Bobby Sanabria    
- Rez Abbasi  
- Marty Ehrlich  
- Andrew Cyrille  
- Nir Felder  
- Allison Miller
- Jim Snidero 
- Andy McKee
- Ahmed Abdullah
and many more  

I took my private lessons with David Schnitter, Darius Jones and Marty Ehrlich. Each helped shape my improvisation, composition, and sound exploration.

## Live Sound
While going to college, I put my other passion for live sound and music production to work. As my father is a sound engineer I had picked up a few things while shadowing him to his gigs. While in NYC, I joined the student lead, tiny desk inspired Sunday Sessions as a backline assistant and assistant live sound engineer. I also mixed performances for artists and students, set up gear for concerts, and ran PA systems outside the school. 


## Current Goals (2024-) 
Since graduating from The New School in 2024, I found a new passion in data analysis and math. To start my new exploration to get a good feel for real world application of what i wanted to do, I earned microcredentials in Excel, Minitab, Power BI, and general data analytics. I liked doing all of that so much that I'm Currently pursuing the Post-Degree Professional Certificate in Data Analytics at Cuyahoga Community College (TRI-C), with a goal of beginning a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Bowling Green State University in Fall 2026. As of sept 2025 I'm still getting everything ready for my application. In the meantime I work as a LAN and Desktop Support Technician for an IT company that oversees more than 250 devices and accounts.
